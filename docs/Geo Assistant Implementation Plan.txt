GeoSpatial AI Assistant for Automotive Mobility & Transportation

Goal
An AI-powered geospatial analysis assistant in the Automotive Mobility & Transportation industry, which supports the following functionality
	1. Understand and analyze geospatial data automatically
	2. Respond to natural language queries about the data
	3. Autonomously decide when to use Azure Maps APIs to enrich data
	4. Generate visualizations based on user prompts
	5. Provide insights without requiring technical expertise from users
	6. Interactive follow-up capabilities based on user prompting.

-------------
Sample user interaction
User: "I've uploaded vehicle tracking data. What patterns do you see?"
Agent:
   - Loads and validates data
   - Identifies key parameters (speed, location, time)
   - Runs pattern analysis
   - Checks if weather/traffic data would add value
   - Generates appropriate visualizations
   - Provides natural language insights
"I notice several interesting patterns:
1. There are frequent stops in these 3 areas (shows heatmap)
2. Traffic conditions significantly impact travel times between 2-4 PM (overlays traffic data)
3. Weather seems to affect vehicle speed in these regions..."

User: "Show me areas with unusual driving patterns"
Agent: *Creates visualization highlighting anomalies, explains reasoning*

User: "What's the environmental impact of these routes?"
Agent: *Enriches data with weather API, analyzes patterns, visualizes results*

User interaction per agent
Agent 1: 
	User: "Analyze this fleet data for the past month"
	[Uploads CSV with columns: timestamp, vehicle_id, lat, long, speed]
	
	Agent: "Analysis complete. Key findings:
	- Peak activity between 8-10 AM and 3-5 PM
	- 3 vehicles showing unusual speed patterns
	- Common stopping points detected at [coordinates]
	- Average route duration: 45 minutes
	Would you like details about any of these findings?"
